This is one of the best assignments you can do to prepare for the qualifying belt exam, as well as to improve your coding skills. It’s designed to ensure you’ve internalized the fundamentals of web programming, and many of our students have made this a part of their portfolio.

We encourage you to finish this assignment if you have time. Also, make sure you use Git to back up your code along the way.
